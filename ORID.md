  **D:**

  - I plan to further refine the creation of user personas and user journeys to deepen my understanding of user-product interaction and optimize the user experience.
  - Next, I need to dive deeper into the practical applications of generative AI, experimenting with different tools and models to better understand how they work.
  - I also plan to study the ethical issues in using generative AI, especially in content creation and data privacy, to ensure I can use it responsibly in the future.
