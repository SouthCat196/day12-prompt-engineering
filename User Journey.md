### **Key Insights:**

1. **High Engagement with AR/VR:** Emma's engagement with both VR and AR technologies enhances her confidence in choosing the right seat and navigating the cinema. This improves her overall satisfaction.
2. Pain Points:
   - **Overwhelming Choices:** At the beginning of the journey, Emma might feel overwhelmed by the variety of movie options and the decision-making process.
   - **AR/VR Feature Delays:** Slow loading or failure of VR/AR features (e.g., seat perspectives or navigation) can cause frustration, affecting the user experience, though the issue is typically temporary.
   - **Venue Navigation Issues:** Despite the AR navigation, there could be moments where Emma might experience confusion, especially when AR features fail to load properly or the app directs her to the wrong location.
3. **Positive Emotional Trajectory:** The overall mood curve is positive throughout the journey, with key moments of excitement when exploring the virtual cinema and satisfaction when the system helps Emma make informed decisions quickly.



### **Prompts**

**Goal:**
Generate a detailed **User Journey** for a movie ticketing system that incorporates AR/VR technologies. The journey should capture key activities, behaviors, emotions (mood curve), and pain points during the ticket purchasing and movie-going process.

**User:**
Target audience: Moviegoers who are tech-savvy, enjoy immersive experiences, and seek convenience in their movie-going journey.

**Instruction:**
AI should generate a **User Journey** that includes the following elements:

1. **Main Activity**: The primary action or step the user takes at each stage of the journey (e.g., browsing movies, purchasing tickets).
2. **Concrete Behavior**: Specific actions the user takes during the activity (e.g., opening the app, selecting seats, etc.).
3. **Mood Curve**: An emotional line showing how the user feels during each stage of the journey (e.g., excited, frustrated, satisfied).
4. **Pain Point**: Frustrations or challenges the user faces during the journey.

The User Journey should be structured in a **table format** to clearly illustrate each step in the process, from browsing movies to the actual cinema visit.

**Details:**
The user journey should be based on a persona like Emma (a tech-savvy, movie-loving individual), and describe the experience of booking tickets using the AR/VR-based system. The journey should highlight the key moments where AR/VR enhances her experience (e.g., virtual seat selection, AR navigation in the cinema). The journey should also capture her emotional highs and lows as she interacts with the system.

**Examples:**

- **Main Activity**: Browsing movies and selecting showtimes
  **Concrete Behavior**: Opens the app, filters by genre, selects a movie and showtime
  **Mood Curve**: Neutral → Curious → Interested
  **Pain Point**: Uncertainty about which movie to pick, feels overwhelmed by choices.
- **Main Activity**: Virtual seat selection using VR
  **Concrete Behavior**: Uses VR headset to explore available seats, view different perspectives
  **Mood Curve**: Excited → Satisfied → Confident
